bootstrap popover additional placement plugin

Since bootstrap does not have top-right, top-left, bottom-right, etc. placements, this plugin can be used to reposition a popover easily by calling the following javascript code:

```javascript

$('some.popover.selector').popshift( placement, top, left );

```
